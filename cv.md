### About me:

I'm at the beginning of my journey to the Frontend Development. 
I'm  curious person and I love the idea of life-long learning that's why I've chosen IT field and decided to take a shot.
The second reason is it’s so rewarding to see something that you have built yourself  even though it is the most easiest task on codewards.
